# Slideshow App
A simple Slideshow App made as part of an hiring assignment

## Task
- The Slides component takes an array of slides as a prop. Each element of this array denotes a single slide and is an object with 2 properties: string title and string text.
- On application launch, the first slide must be rendered.
- Clicking on the "Next" button shows the next slide. This button is disabled when the current slide is the last one.
- Clicking on the "Prev" button shows the previous slide. This button is disabled when the current slide is the first one.
- Clicking on the "Restart" button returns to the first slide. This button is disabled when the current slide is the first one.
- You can assume that the passed slides array contains at least one slide.
